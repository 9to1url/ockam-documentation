# Zero \[ Implicit ] Trust

Modern applications operate in untrusted networks and increasingly rely on third-party services and infrastructure. This creates exponential growth in their vulnerability surface.

Ockam gives you the tools to eliminate implicit trust in networks, services, and infrastructure. Applications get provable cryptographic identities to authenticate and authorize every access decision.

Applications have moved out of enterprise data centers into multi-tenant cloud and edge environments. They operate in untrusted networks and increasingly rely on third-party managed services and infrastructure. This creates exponential growth in the **vulnerability surface of our application data**.

Data, within our applications, routinely flows over complex, multi-hop, multi-protocol routes — across network boundaries, beyond data centers, through queues and caches, via gateways and brokers — before reaching its end destination. The vulnerability surfaces of all these dependencies get added to the vulnerability surface of our application data and make it _unmanageable_.

Ockam end-to-end secure channels enable **application layer encryption** of all **data-in-motion**. The data integrity and confidentiality guarantee, of these channels, create a deny-by-default security posture that minimizes our vulnerability surface and gives our application true control over every data or service access decision. ****&#x20;
