# Powerful Protocols, Made Simple

To be private and secure by design, applications must have granular control over every trust and access decision.

This requires a variety of complex cryptographic and messaging protocols to work together in a secure and scalable way.

Developers have to think about creating unique cryptographic keys and issuing credentials to all application entities. They have to design ways to safely store secrets in hardware and securely distribute roots of trust. They must setup communication channels that guarantee data authenticity and integrity. They must enforce authorization policies. They also need protocols that rotate and revoke credentials.
