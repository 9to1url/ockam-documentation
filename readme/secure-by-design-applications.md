# Secure by Design Applications

Secure By Design applications minimize their vulnerability surface and embrace the principle of least privilege.

Ockam’s end-to-end secure channels guarantee application layer data integrity and authenticity for all data-in-motion. This enables a deny-by-default security posture that minimizes an application’s vulnerability surface and brings true control over every access decision.
