# Introduction to Ockam

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management, and authorization policy enforcement – at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. To **build** **trust** for **data-in-motion**, applications need end-to-end guarantees of data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To be **private** and **secure** **by-design**, applications must have granular control over every trust and access decision. Ockam allows you to add these controls and guarantees to any application.

Ockam was made for millions of builders. We are passionate about simple developer experiences and easy to use tools. Just like Stripe did for payment rails and Twilio did for telecom, Ockam abstracts away complex infrastructure and cryptography to empower millions of developers.

Ockam empowers you to:

* Create end-to-end encrypted, authenticated **Secure Channels** over any transport topology.
* Provision **Encrypted** **Relays** for trustful communication within applications that are distributed across many edge, cloud and data-center private networks.
* Tunnel legacy protocols through mutually authenticated and encrypted **Portals.**
* Add-ons to bring end-to-end encryption to enterprise messaging, pub/sub and event streams.
* Generate unique cryptographically provable **Identities** and store private keys in safe **Vaults.** Add-ons for hardware or cloud key management systems.
* Operate project specific and scalable **Credential Authorities** to issue lightweight, short-lived, easy to revoke, attribute-based credentials.
* Onboard fleets of self-sovereign application identities using **Secure Enrollment Protocols** to issue credentials to application clients and services.
* **Rotate** and **revoke** keys and credentials – at scale, across fleets.
* Define and enforce project-wide **Attribute Based Access Control** (ABAC) policies.
* Add-ons to integrate with enterprise **Identity Providers** and **Policy Providers**.
