# Introduction to Ockam

Ockam makes it simple for everyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services that orchestrate the end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key / credential management, and authorization policy enforcements of data-in-motion; at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. Applications can only trust the data that they receive when the data has end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality guarantees.

We make it simple for applications to:

* Create end-to-end encrypted and authenticated **Channels** over any transport topology.
* Provision encrypted **Relays** for trustful communication within applications that are distributed across many private edge, cloud and data center networks.
* Bring integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality to legacy protocols by tunneling them through mutually authenticated and encrypted **Portals.**
* Generate unique cryptographic **Identities** and store private keys in secure hardware or cloud key management systems.
* Operate project specific and scalable **Credential Authorities** to issue lightweight, short-lived, easy to revoke, attribute-based credentials.
* Enroll fleets of self-sovereign, application identities and issue them credentials.
* **Rotate** and **revoke** keys and credentials â€“ at scale.
* Define and enforce project-wide **Attribute Based Access Control** (ABAC) policies.
* Integrate with Enterprise Identity Providers, Policy Providers,&#x20;
