# Introduction to Ockam

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management, and authorization policy enforcement – at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. To **build** **trust** for **data-in-motion**, applications need end-to-end guarantees of data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To be **private** and **secure** **by-design**, applications must have granular control over every trust and access decision.

In a few simple steps, with Ockam, you can add these controls and guarantees to any application:

* Create end-to-end encrypted and authenticated **Channels** over any transport topology.
* Provision encrypted **Relays** for trustful communication within applications that are distributed across many edge, cloud and data center private networks.
* Tunnel legacy protocols through mutually authenticated and encrypted **Portals.**
* Add end-to-end encryption to enterprise messaging and event streaming systems.
* Generate unique cryptographically provable **Identities** and store private keys in safe hardware or cloud key management systems.
* Operate project specific and scalable **Credential Authorities** to issue lightweight, short-lived, easy to revoke, attribute-based credentials.
* Onboard fleets of self-sovereign application identities using secure enrollment protocols to issue credentials to application clients and services.
* **Rotate** and **revoke** keys and credentials – at scale, across fleets.
* Define and enforce project-wide **Attribute Based Access Control** (ABAC) policies.
* Integrate with enterprise Identity Providers and Policy Providers.
