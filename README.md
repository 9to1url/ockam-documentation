# What is Ockam?

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management & authorization policy enforcement â€” at scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. They must guarantee end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data.

Secure by-design applications have granular control over every trust and access decision.&#x20;

We make it simple for anyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.



We enable applications to:

* Create end-to-end encrypted and authenticated channels over any transport topology.
* Create encrypted cloud relays for end-to-end secure communication within applications that are distributed across many
* Generate unique cryptographic identities and use them for mutual authentication.
* Safely generate and store private keys in hardware or in cloud key management systems.
* Easily provision and enroll fleets of self-sovereign, application identities&#x20;
* Issue attribute based credentials and use them to granularly authorize access.
* Operate project specific, secure and scalable Credential Authorities to issue light weight, short-lived, easy to revoke, granular, attribute-based credentials.
* Easily rotate and revoke private keys and credentials.
