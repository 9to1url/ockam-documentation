# What is Ockam?

Ockam is a suite of **open source** tools, programming libraries and cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management & authorization policy enforcement â€” at scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. Ockam makes it simple to build **secure by-design** applications that have granular control over every trust and access decision.
