# Ockam is Trust for Data-in-Motion

Ockam makes it simple for everyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services that orchestrate the end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key / credential management, and authorization policy enforcements of data-in-motion; at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. Applications can only trust the data that they receive when the data has end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality guarantees.





We enable applications to:

* Create end-to-end encrypted and authenticated channels over any transport topology.
* Create encrypted cloud relays for end-to-end secure communication within applications that are distributed across many
* Generate unique cryptographic identities and use them for mutual authentication.
* Safely generate and store private keys in hardware or in cloud key management systems.
* Easily provision and enroll fleets of self-sovereign, application identities&#x20;
* Issue attribute based credentials and use them to granularly authorize access.
* Operate project specific, secure and scalable Credential Authorities to issue light weight, short-lived, easy to revoke, granular, attribute-based credentials.
* Easily rotate and revoke private keys and credentials.
* Be given granular control over every trust and access decision that they need to make. &#x20;
