# What is Ockam?

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management & authorization policy enforcement â€” at scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. Secure by-design applications have granular control over every trust and access decision. We make it simple for anyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.

that guarantee end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data.

### Ockam Open Source

Ockam Open Source tools and programming libraries allow applications to:

* Create end-to-end encrypted and mutually authenticated secure channels over any transport topology
* Generate unique cryptographic identities
* and safely store private keys in hardware or in cloud key management systems.
* Issue attribute based credentials and use them to authorize access.
* &#x20;easy to rotate and revoke identity keys.

### Ockam Orchestrator

Ockam Orchestrator is an enterprise ready, managed cloud service that makes it easy:

* Coordinate and relay end-to-end encrypted communication within heavily distributed applications.
* Enroll
* Provision
* Manage
* Scale
