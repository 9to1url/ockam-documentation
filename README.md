# Ockam is Trust for Data-in-Motion

Ockam makes it simple for everyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services that orchestrate the end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key / credential management, and authorization policy enforcements of data-in-motion; at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. Applications can only trust the data that they receive when the data has end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality guarantees.

We make it simple for anyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.





* Create end-to-end encrypted and authenticated **Channels** over any transport topology – _across data centers, through queues and caches, via gateways and brokers._
* Create encrypted **Relays** for end-to-end secure communication within applications that are distributed across many private edge, cloud and data center networks.
* Bring integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality to legacy protocols by tunneling them through end-to-end encrypted and mutually authenticated **Portals.**



* Generate unique cryptographic identities and use them for mutual authentication.
* Easily provision and enroll fleets of self-sovereign, application identities&#x20;
* Safely generate and store private keys in hardware or in cloud key management systems.
*
* Issue attribute based credentials and use them to granularly authorize access.
* Operate project specific, secure and scalable Credential Authorities to issue light weight, short-lived, easy to revoke, granular, attribute-based credentials.
* Easily rotate and revoke private keys and credentials.
* . Manage rotation and revocation of keys and credentials at scale
* Scale
* Policies
* ABAC / RBAC / ACLs
* Add-Ons
* Integrate with Enterprise Identity Providers
* Policy Providers
