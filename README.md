# What is Ockam?

Ockam is a suite of open source tools, programming libraries, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management & authorization policy enforcement â€” at scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. Secure by-design applications have granular control over every trust and access decision. We make it simple for anyone to build modern, secure by-design applications.



that guarantee end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data.
