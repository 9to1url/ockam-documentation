# Build Secure-by-Design Applications

We've built Ockam with **all** builders in mind and have two different configurations to choose from:

Ockam Open Source can be used for small scale personal projects where manual configuration and simple architectures fit the bill.

Ockam Orchestrator should be used in a company setting. Orchestrator has all of the features that you'll need to collaborate with your team, integrate with automated infrastructure, and serve massive scale throughput.



### Ockam Open Source

Ockam Open Source tools and programming libraries enable applications to:

* Create end-to-end encrypted and authenticated **Channels** over any transport topology.
* Provision encrypted **Relays** for trustful communication within applications that are distributed across many edge, cloud and data-center private networks.
* Tunnel legacy protocols through mutually authenticated and encrypted **Portals.**
* Generate unique cryptographically provable **Identities** and store private keys in safe **Vaults.**
* Safely generate and store private keys in hardware or in cloud key management systems.
* Issue attribute based credentials and use them to granularly authorize access.
* Easily rotate and revoke private keys and credentials.
