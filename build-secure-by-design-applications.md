# Build Secure-by-Design Applications

We've built Ockam with **all** builders in mind and have two different configurations to choose from:

Ockam Open Source can be used for small scale personal projects where manual configuration and simple architectures fit the bill.

Ockam Orchestrator should be used in a company setting. Orchestrator has all of the features that you'll need to collaborate with your team, integrate with automated infrastructure, and serve massive scale throughput.



### Ockam Open Source

Ockam Open Source tools and programming libraries enable applications to:

* Operate in any environment - cloud virtual machines or constrained embedded devices.
* Safely Generate, Store, Rotate and Revoke **Cryptographic Keys.**
* Generate unique cryptographically provable **Identities** and manage private keys in safe **Vaults.**
* **Vault Add-Ons** for various TEEs, TPMs, HSMs, Secure Enclaves, and Cloud KMSs.
* Deliver messages reliably over any Transport topology using - Application Layer **Routing**.
* Create end-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated, and authorized **Secure Channels** over multi-hop, multi-protocol **Transport** topologies.
* **Transport Add-Ons** for various protocols TCP, UDP, WebSockets, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN etc.
* Securely traverse NATs and protocol gateways using **** end-to-end encrypted **Relays.**&#x20;
* Tunnel any application protocol through mutually authenticated and encrypted **Portals.**
* Create **Credential Authorities** to issue lightweight, attribute-based credentials**.**
* Securely Issue, Store, Present, and Verify cryptographically verifiable **Credentials**.
* Define and enforce Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) **Policies**.
