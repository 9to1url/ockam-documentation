# Rust

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Get Started" %}
If you don't have it, please [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) the latest version of Rust.



```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```



Next, create a new cargo project to get started:

```bash
cargo new --lib hello_ockam && cd hello_ockam && mkdir examples \
  && cargo add ockam && cargo build
```

If the above instructions don't work on your machine, please [post a question](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/discussions), we’d love to help.
