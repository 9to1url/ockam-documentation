In this step-by-step guide we try various Ockam sub commands to understand the various building blocks that make up Ockam.



Ockam Orchestrator is a managed cloud service that enables team and companies to:

* Operate highly secure and scalable **Managed Credential Authorities**.
* Provision **Managed Rotation Endpoints** to implement application fleet wide credential rotation and revocation. Issue, Rotate, Revoke least-privileged, short-lived credentials.
* Provision **Managed Enrollment Endpoints** to easily issue fine-grained attribute-based credentials to fleets of application identities using a variety of secure enrollment protocols.
* Enable **Identity Provider Add-Ons** to integrate with enterprise workforce identity and customer identity systems like Okta, Auth0, AzureAD etc. and issue fine-grained, short-lived, just-in-time Ockam credentials to enterprise identities.
* Define, distribute and enforce application fleet-wide **Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)** policies. Chose your authorization model: ABAC, RBAC or ACLs.
* Enable **Policy Provider Add-Ons** to integrate with enterprise policies.
* Provision **Managed Policy Decision Points** to create one place for all authorization decisions.
* Provision highly scalable and reliable **Managed Encrypted** **Relays** for end-to-end encrypted, high-throughput, low latency communication within applications that are distributed across many edge, cloud and data-center private networks.
* Provision **Managed Rendezvous** to facilitate UDP based NAT traversal.
* Enable **Stream Add-Ons** to bring end-to-end encryption to enterprise messaging and event streaming systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, Kinesis etc.
* Enable **Vault Add-Ons** to safely store keys in cloud key management systems.
* Enterprise Support.

**Commercial support for Ockam Orchestrator is available** [**through the AWS Marketplace**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-wsd42efzcpsxk)**.**

## Get Started

#### Homebrew

If you use Homebrew, you can install Ockam using `brew`.

```bash
brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam
```

#### Precompiled Binaries

Otherwise, you can download our latest architecture specific pre-compiled binary by running:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/build-trust/ockam/develop/install.sh | sh
```

After the binary downloads, please move it to a location in your shell's `$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin`.

If the above instructions don't work on your machine, please [post a question](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/discussions), weâ€™d love to help.
