# Secure Channels

In previous sections we saw how Ockam [<mark style="color:blue;">Routing</mark>](routing.md) and [<mark style="color:blue;">Transports</mark>](routing.md#transport)<mark style="color:blue;">,</mark> when combined with the ability to model [<mark style="color:blue;">Bridges</mark>](advanced-routing.md) and [<mark style="color:blue;">Relays</mark>](advanced-routing.md#relay), make it possible to <mark style="color:orange;">create end-to-end, application layer protocols in</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">**any**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">communication topology</mark> - across networks, clouds, and boundaries.

Ockam Secure Channels is an end-to-end protocol build on top of Ockam Routing. Once a channel is established, it has the following <mark style="color:orange;">end-to-end guarantees</mark>:

1. **Authenticity:** Each end of the channel knows that messages received on the channel must have been sent by someone who possesses the secret keys of specific Ockam Identifier.
2. **Integrity:** Each end of the channel knows that the messages received on the channel could not have been tapered en-route and are exactly what was sent by the authenticated sender at the other end of the channel.
3. **Confidentiality:**  Each end of the channel knows that the contents of messages received on the channel could not have been observed en-route between the sender and the receiver.

Establishing a secure channel requires establishing a shared secret key between the two entities that wish to communicate securely. This is usually achieved using a cryptographic key agreement protocol to safely derive a shared secret without transporting it over the network.
