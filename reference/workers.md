# Workers

Ockam Workers are lightweight, concurrent, stateful actors.

Workers:

* Run in an Ockam Node.
* Have an application-defined address (like a postal mail or email address).
* Can maintain internal state.
* Can start other new workers.
* Can handle messages from other workers running on the same or a different node.
* Can send messages to other workers running on the same or a different node.
