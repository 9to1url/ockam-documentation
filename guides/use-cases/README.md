  Ockam is a set of building blocks to Build Trust between distributed
  applications.
---

# Use Cases

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. To [trust data-in-motion](./#trust-for-data-in-motion), applications need end-to-end guarantees of data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To be [private](./#private-and-secure-by-design) and [secure-by-design](./#private-and-secure-by-design), applications must have granular control over every trust and access decision. Ockam allows you to add these controls and guarantees to any application.
