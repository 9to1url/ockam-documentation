# Use Cases



### Next Steps with the Rust Library

* **Build End-to-End Encryption with Rust**: In this hands-on guide, we create two small Rust programs called Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob send each other messages, over the network, via a cloud service. They mutually authenticate each other and have a cryptographic guarantee that the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of their messages is protected end-to-end. ðŸ‘‰
* **Build End-to-End Encryption through Kafka**: In this guide, we show two programs called Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob send each other messages, over the network, via a cloud service, _through Kafka_. They mutually authenticate each other and have a cryptographic guarantee that the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of their messages is protected end-to-end. The Kafka instance, the intermediary cloud service and attackers on the network are not be able to see or change the contents of en-route messages. The application data in Kafka is encrypted. ðŸ‘‰
* **How to end-to-end encrypt all application layer communication**: In this hands-on guide, we'll create two simple Rust programs to **transparently tunnel** arbitrary application layer communication through Ockam's end-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated secure channels. These example programs are also available in a docker image so you can try them without setting up a rust toolchain. ðŸ‘‰
* **Build a secure access tunnel to a service in a remote private network**: In this guide, we'll write a few simple Rust programs to programmatically create secure access tunnels to remote services and devices that are running in a private network, behind a NAT. We'll then tunnel arbitrary communication protocols through these secure tunnels. ðŸ‘‰
* **Step-by-Step Deep Dive**: In this step-by-step guide we write many small rust programs to understand the various building blocks that make up Ockam. We dive into Node, Workers, Routing, Transport, Secure Channels and more. ðŸ‘‰
