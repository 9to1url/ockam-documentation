# Ockam Command

In this step-by-step guide we try various Ockam sub commands to understand the various building blocks that make up Ockam.

## Get Started

#### Homebrew

If you use Homebrew, you can install Ockam using `brew`.

```bash
brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam
```

#### Precompiled Binaries

Otherwise, you can download our latest architecture specific pre-compiled binary by running:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/build-trust/ockam/develop/install.sh | sh
```

After the binary downloads, please move it to a location in your shell's `$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin`.

If the above instructions don't work on your machine, please [post a question](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/discussions), weâ€™d love to help.
